Installing PubMed Retraction Analysis
=====================================

This project ships with a script that automates the entire installation
process on any UNIX-like system. It has been tested on macOS versions 10.10
- 10.12 and Ubuntu Server 12.04. Run it using the bundled `install.py` file.

The pre-requisites are to have:
 - An installed nodejs runtime
 - An installed python runtime
 - virtualenv

Out of those depenencies, it is likely that unless you already have a
python development setup running, you will not have virtualenv. virtualenv is
strictly-speaking optional, but highly recommended because it isolates all
python dependencies into a single directory and does not permit interference
between applications. You can get virtualenv by running:

# sudo pip install virtualenv

Running `install.py` will run the following:
 - Creating a new python virtual environment using either the standard system
   python installation or the python binary in `PYTHON`. This project has been
   tested on Python 2 and 3, so either version will work.
 - Installing project level python dependencies inside that virtual environment.
 - Installing the python project inside that virtual environment
 - Installing nodejs (backend) dependencies inside the current directory.

As per the script's instructions, you will need to enter the python
virtual environment if you wish to run any of the python code such as the
downloaders. You can do that by using the `source` command in `bash`:

$ source python-virtualenv/bin/activate

Seeding the Database
====================

If you wish to run your own database, you will need to seed it with some data.
This is a three-step process.

First, use `download-pubmed-articles` to download some articles. They will
appear in the `Retractions` subdirectory by default, or in any directory
specified by `--output`. By default, all articles will be downloaded, but if
you only want to download a few, you can pass `--article-count=N` to download
N articles.

Then, use `parse-pubmed-files DIR` where DIR is the directory articles are
stored. This will emit a JSON-representation of parsed data to the standard
output, which can be redirected to a file if you wish.

With that JSON representation, you can then call `load-pubmed-files FILE` to
seed a database. You will need to set the database environment variables
DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_USER and DATABASE_PASS for this command to run. `FILE`
specifies the JSON file to load which was emitted earlier by
`parse-pubmed-files`.

Note that running `load-pubmed-files` will clear any existing entries in the
database and re-seed it from scratch.
